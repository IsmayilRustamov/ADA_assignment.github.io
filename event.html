        <h2>HOUR OF CODE</h2>
        <p>
          Dear all, I am delighted to share the success of the Hour of Code
          event that took place at Sumgayit Natural Sciences Gymnasium on
          November 3, 2023, organized by our team comprising Ilkin Hasanov,
          Rahib Babashli, Ismayil Rustamov and Murad Abbasov. Our team, had the
          privilege of conducting this event with the enthusiastic participation
          of 25 students from 6th grades. The primary objective of the Hour of
          Code event was to introduce fundamental algorithms, provide an
          overview of computer science, and offer insights into programming for
          the participating students. We aimed to ignite their interest in the
          world of technology and equip them with basic coding skills. During
          the event, we engaged the students with informative sessions on
          algorithms and programming. The participants actively took part in
          solving various puzzles and completing courses from the code.org
          platform. This hands-on experience was aimed at demystifying coding
          and making it more accessible to the young minds. At the conclusion of
          the Hour of Code event, certificates were awarded to the students as a
          recognition of their active participation and dedication. We believe
          that the knowledge and experience gained during this event will serve
          as a foundation for the students, inspiring them to continue learning,
          exploring, and contributing to the field of information technology in
          the future. The event also provided a platform for students to inquire
          about ADA University, the admissions process, and seek guidance on
          implementing codes. Their curiosity and engagement demonstrated a keen
          interest in pursuing further studies in computer science. In
          conclusion, the Hour of Code event was a resounding success, and we
          are optimistic that the knowledge imparted will empower the students
          to navigate the exciting world of IT. We express our gratitude to
          everyone involved and look forward to more collaborative
          initiatives in the future.
